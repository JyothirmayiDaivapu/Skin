 <p><h3>1.Gently cleanse</h3> <br>

    Maybe because we’re busy piling stuff onto our faces, we don’t notice all the terrible ingredients in our bodywash. Perfumes, dyes, and harsh soaps like sodium lauryl sulphate are all very common and may dry out your skin. For people with even more sensitive skin, these might be the root cause of your skin irritation or allergic reactions.</p> <br>

    <p><h3> 2.Exfoliate</h3>  <br>
        
         Rather than using a scrub, look for products with alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs). “These acids exfoliate the skin surface and improve its texture.
        
        Apart from giving you glowing skin, these groups of acids can double down on your body acne and catch what the body wash didn’t.</p><br>

        <p> <h3>3.Shaving</h3><br>
            
            “If you first exfoliate, you’ll bring the hairs completely out of the follicles,” says Jaliman. This lessens the risk of ingrown hairs and irritation.
            
            You should also hydrate and soften said hairs by first soaking in a tub or taking a shower. Make sure to use shaving gel and a razor with multiple blades. “And always moisturize your skin immediately after shaving,” Sokumbi adds.</p><br>
            
            <p><h3>4.Moisturize</h3>

                “Moisturizing right after showering helps trap some of the water in your skin, keeping it hydrated,” says Jaliman.
                
                Unlike with your face, you can probably get away with using heavier ingredients like coconut or almond oil on the body without fearing clogged pores and breakouts. That said, if you’re acne-prone, you might want to stick to a lotion.</p>
